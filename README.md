Streamlit demo project to generate PDF from Latex Document.

Functionality is quite limited, but it is a start. You cannot use latex files that have references to other files, therefore you have to put everything into one latex file. Maybe conversion of some latex documents fail because of missing latex packages.

## Status

> Work in progress - Basic Functionality works - Last changed: 2023-02-24

## Issues

- Functionality is very limited. Only single file project, you cannot reference to other files, etc.
- Maybe some additional Latex packages are missing.
- ACE Editor does not work as expected, content cannot be updated.

## ToDo

- [ ] Support for whole latex project (multiple files)
- [ ] Allow upload of multiple files or zip file with whole latex project
- [ ] Add more Latex packages(?)
- [ ] Cleanup unused code
- [ ] Custom CSS styling
